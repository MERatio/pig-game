      <h1 class="h1-title">Pig (Dice game)</h1>
      <h2 class="h2-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
      <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
      </p>
      <ul class="rules-list">
        <li class="rules-item">If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
        </li>
        <li class="rules-item">If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the
          player's turn continues.</li>
        <li class="rules-item">If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it
          becomes the next player's turn.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could hold and score 5
        points, but chooses
        to roll again. Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll
        again. Donald rolls a
        1, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5,
        after which she chooses
        to hold, and adds her turn total of 22 points to her score.</p>
